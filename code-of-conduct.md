# Adafruit Discord Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
all.

On Discord, please avoid using nicknames or avatar images that might detract
from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment. This includes but is not
limited to use of overtly sexual, vulgar or otherwise offensive nicknames or
avatar images.

Please avoid excessive helping. Excessive helping is defined as providing help
that was not asked for. If someone asks a question, be sure that you're
providing the help that was requested and not providing unnecessary information
beyond the scope of the question. Allow the person asking the question to drive
the conversation. If you feel the need to "take the keyboard away" from the
person requesting assistance, reconsider how you're trying to answer. If you're
doing all the talking, you might be excessively helping.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Be kind and courteous to others
* Behaving professionally
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* The use of inappropriate images in a user's avatar or inappropriate nicknames
* Any spamming, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior
* Excessive helping
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported in the following ways. You may send an open message from any channel
to all Community Helpers by tagging @community helpers. You may send an open
message from any channel or a direct message to @kattni#1507, @tannewt#4653,
@Dan Halbert#1614, @cater#2442, or @Andon#8175. You may also send an email to
<support@adafruit.com>. All complaints will
be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The moderation team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident. Be aware, if you send a message in an open channel, your report will
not be anonymous. In situations where the issue is particularly egregious,
requires immediate action, and no moderators are available, you can also report
the message directly to Discord.

Further details of specific enforcement policies are outlined in the
Moderation section.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community’s standards of conduct.

1. Messages, nicknames and avatar images that violate the Adafruit Discord
standards of conduct, including anything hateful, hurtful, oppressive,
or exclusionary, are not allowed.
2. Messages, nicknames and avatar images that moderators find inappropriate,
whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.
3. Moderators will first respond to such messages, nicknames and avatar images
with a warning.
4. We have a soft "three strikes" policy - we are willing to give you two more
chances to change your behavior. However, how you respond to the warning is 
important - it will determine whether we give you further chances.
5. If you are receptive to the warning and change your behavior, nickname
or avatar image accordingly, you will be given another chance.
6. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be “kicked,” i.e., kicked out of
the communication channel to cool off.
7. If the user returns and continues the behavior, they will be banned,
i.e., indefinitely excluded.
8. If the user is unreceptive or unreasonable when warned by a moderator,
they may be banned for a first or second offense.
9. If the behavior is an egregious violation, the user may be banned
immediately, without warning.

Don’t just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In
particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if
they’re off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt
feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community
entirely.

If someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to
be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize.
Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good
there was something you could’ve communicated better — remember that it’s your
responsibility to make your fellow Adafruit Discord community members
comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost
because we want to talk about cool technology. You will find that people will
be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.

## Scope

The enforcement policies listed above apply to all official Adafruit venues.
This includes but is not limited to the entire Adafruit Discord server, GitHub
repositories under Adafruit, and all forums under forums.adafruit.com.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

For other projects adopting the Adafruit Discord Code of Conduct, please
contact the maintainers of those projects for enforcement. If you wish to use
this code of conduct for your own project, consider explicitly mentioning
your moderation policy or making a copy with your own moderation policy so as
to avoid confusion.
